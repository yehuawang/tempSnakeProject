## Process

### Team Organization

#### Organisation tools:  

  - Trello for tracking project progress  
  - Github for code integration  
  - Discord for hosting team meetings and sharing inspiring ideas  
  - LettuceMeet for scheduling and organising team meetings. 

##### Front End

1. **Aryan Kalra:** Mainly focusing on UI needs and design using figma and other front-end tasks as needed such as translating said figma concepts to the web page

2. **Junwei Q:** user/chat interface for AI, generative AI API calls, game interface implementation  

##### Back End  

1. **Lynne Hamd:** Focusing on Postman testing to ensure smooth link between frontend and backend  

2. **Yihan Wang**: focusing on basic project setup, coordination between development and design. Defining interfaces and classes as designed.  

3. **Pratham:** Database integration, game design and server side logic  

4. **Junwei**: Server side logic for generative AI integration

### Decision making  
     
> Our decision-making process is based on a democratic approach. Major decisions are discussed in weekly meetings (time described in team-contract.pdf), where each team member is given the opportunity to share their input. All team members must reach a consensus before any new feature or changes are added.

      
### Prioritising user stories:

*(Written using MoSCoW method)*

##### Must have:

- User interface for selecting different games  
- More than one mini-game  
- User dashboard  
- User Login page  
- Timer and Scoring System  

##### Should have  

- Allowing users to update their profile picture, bio, username  
- History of user attempts in the respective game  
- Tips and Game Levels  

##### Can have:  

- Real-time analytics on user performance among peers  
- AI chat bot  
- AI API image and phrase generation.  
- Game achievement and badges 

##### Wonâ€™t have:  

- Payment feature  
- Multiplayer mode  
- Uploading user feature (can be built on later as an after-course project)

    
### Meetings

##### At least 3 standup meeting (5 min) per week  

-  Meeting times may vary depends on team member needs.  

##### Mandatory: 

- (in person) Tuesday / Thursday after lecture @ 7:00 pm  

##### Optional:

- (in person) Wednesday tutorial @ 11:30 am \- 1:00 pm  

##### As needed:

- (discord) any night @ 10:00 pm

### Next Phase:

- In the next phase, we will document and record team meetings, including future decisions, overview on current completed steps, and merge decision of pull request and modifications.  
- We have discovered new development and managing tools as we proceed in this project, which will be gradually integrated into our development.  
- Most people are learning along the way building this project, therefore we are actively adding new knowledge, specifically related to the MERN stack, which is what our project will be implemented with.  
- We have found out that sharing useful tutorial videos / blog posts / documentations were helpful to the overall team intelligence, therefore we will continue doing this and bring it into the next sprint (sprint 1).  
- Currently the basic backbone structure for the project has been set up to GitHub (with both front and backend framework). For the next phase, we aim to implement the basic home page, game play page, user sign up page, and user profile page. As well as at least implementing one mini game onto the home page.
