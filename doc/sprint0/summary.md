# Summary

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of our project is to develop a platform resembling the Human Benchmark website [https://humanbenchmark.com/], offering users a set of simple reflection and cognitive games for entertainment purposes. The platform will include performance summaries, visualizations of user rankings, and AI-powered phrase & image generation to keep our test data set always fresh and engaging.

## Key Users
- **Casual gamers**: Individuals looking to improve their cognitive skills through short, engaging games.
- **Students**: Users seeking a fun way to practice reflection and cognitive skills.
- **family and party**: Users searching for chill little games with competition features to have fun with family and friends.

## Scenarios
1. **Game Play**: A user can choose to play from a reaction time test to measure how fast they respond to visual stimuli.
2. **Performance Summary**: After finishing a game, the user sees their score, how it compares to their previous scores, and how they rank among other users.
3. **AI Chat Feature**: The user engages with the AI chat for tips on improving cognitive skills, generating motivational phrases, or even receiving a custom-generated image.
4. **User Comparison**: A graph shows the userâ€™s position in comparison to the average user, helping to visualize progress over time.

## Principles
- **User-Centered Design**: Focus on simple, engaging user experiences.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure all user data, including performance and personal information, is securely stored and handled.
- **Accessibility**: The platform will be designed to accommodate users with different cognitive abilities.
