### John:

- John is determined, after one final exam which he did poorly despite he spends long time studying before the exam, to improve his memorising skills as a long term goal and fix the problem of forgetting academic terms quickly. John searches on tik tok and sees someone suggesting he try some simple memorising games daily, so he goes online and finds our website.

### Jake:

Traditional training methods like repetitive aim trainers don't appeal to him, he wishes to improve on a light-weight portable platform. Then Jake turned online to search for platforms providing the set of practices for his gaming skills.

- **Integration of AI:**
  - The platform will utilise generative AI to power our database with diverse images and phrases, which enhances user experience with unique pictures or words at each game play.
