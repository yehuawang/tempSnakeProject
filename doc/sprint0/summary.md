# Summary

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of our project is to develop a platform resembling the Human Benchmark website [https://humanbenchmark.com/], offering users a set of simple reflection and cognitive games for entertainment purposes.

## Scenarios
1. **Game Play**: A user can choose to play from a set of reaction games and cognitive games, including quick memorization of images, word
2. **Performance Summary**: After finishing a game, the user sees their score, timing, how it compares to their previous scores, and how they rank among other users.
3. **AI Chat Bot**: The user engages with the AI chat for tips on improving cognitive skills, generating motivational phrases, or even receiving a custom-generated image.

## Principles
- **User-Centered Design**: Focus on simple, engaging user experiences.
