## Why is Our Project better?

**We are aiming for:**

- **Small concise games**  
- **Games can be played on the fly, users would not need to worry about if they have enough time, and do not need to suffer the frustration of not seeing any feedback when they have to leave early.**  
- **We will include trending games that every user wants!**  
- **We incorporate expandability, allowing the platform to continuously add more on-demand games.**  
- **Our platform is supported with AI to generate diverse, innovative, eye- catching images and interesting phrases to enhance our database and ensures we always have non-repeated data to give to users in each test.**  
- **Our platform will provide  a simple yet complete navigation interface to boost user experience. Regardless of user age group, users will be able to find an UI suiting their taste and needs.**  
- **We do not share our user data to third party institutions, so users do not need to worry about their data being given out.**  
- **We include instructions and rules for each game in short, clear sentences so that the users will not feel redundant and will be willing to finish reading in a few seconds.**  
- **We design our tests and games based on user experiences, we test and redesign our games until it meets general satisfaction.**

**Our users:**

- **All age groups, from children older than 6 to seniors younger than 99. We are able to provide accommodation to each user group.**  
- **However, our main targeted users will be the young generation of 16 - 30, where we will update new games majorly based on the main targeted user groupâ€™s taste and based on what is trending in these user groups.**

**Why did other products not do well on our main targeted user group?**

- **What our opponents failed to capture is the user groups in 16 - 30 highly evaluate the games on whether they are trending and popular.**  
- **We aim to provide our main targeted users with the most up to date trending mini games. Where our users will find confidence that, everytime they see a fun game on Tik Tok or Youtube or Instagram, they will be able to find it or a similar version on our website.**  
- **We make our platform very adaptive to scalability, where we focus on fast iteration of delivery of different trending games instead of always providing a fixed set of games.**
